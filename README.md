# That Which Echoes Across Our Home
A city building game which guides you along the discovery and mapping of a new city, its districts, and its landmarks. Along the way you'll create generations of residents, communities, and factions and investigate what parts of the city they claim as their own, their clashes amongst themselves, and the heritage they leave to the city in their wake.
