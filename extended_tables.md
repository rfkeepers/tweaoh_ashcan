# Additional Tables

You aren't required to use these tables through the game.  They're here to help crystalize the imagination.  Use them as much or as little as you want.

## Flair

The following table can be combined with any other table to add a flourish of color to a thing.  Not every combination is going to make sense (ex: what is a posh refuse pile?) but figuring that out will sometimes be half the fun.  Or it just won't work at all.  Use it or skip it as wanted.
